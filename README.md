This is your README.md file where you can write your reflection response for this programming project.

For me personally the easiest part of this lab would be declaring and initializing the object, the very basic step to OOP, I have it mastered such as coding the declaration to the constructor, setters, and getters. I have previously attempted a similar course in my past so I have seen this structure for quite some time, so im very familiar with it. The hardest part of this lab of me was being able to read and populate data from the file. Im new to the file handling aspect of programming still and so learning how to do so was quite the challenge for me. Im still a bit uneasy with handling file data but now I have an idea of what needs to happen for your program to run without issues.
